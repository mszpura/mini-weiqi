# Discord Activity - React, Multiplayer Video (TS)

Welcome to your fresh **[Robo.js](https://github.com/Wave-Play/robo)** project!

Build, deploy, and maintain your Discord activities with ease. With Robo.js as your guide, you'll experience a seamless, [file-based setup](https://docs.roboplay.dev/docs/basics/overview#the-robojs-file-structure), an [integrated database](https://docs.roboplay.dev/docs/basics/flashcore), [TypeScript support](https://docs.roboplay.dev/docs/advanced/typescript), and a multitude of [plugin-powered skills](https://docs.roboplay.dev/docs/advanced/plugins) to unlock along the way.

## ✨ Getting Started

Create a project with this template, replacing `<project-name>` with your desired name:

```bash
npx create-robo --template discord-activities/react-multiplayer-video-ts --name <project-name>
```

Then navigate into your project directory:

```bash
cd <project-name>
```

Run development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run with a Cloudflare tunnel:

```bash
npm run dev:tunnel
```

> **Notes:** The app runs on `http://localhost:3000` and the API server runs on `http://localhost:3001` (proxied by Vite). When you edit API routes under `src/api`, restart `npm run dev` to rebuild API output. API port is forced via `ROBO_SERVER_PORT` to avoid `.env` `PORT` conflicts.

## App Development 🛠️

You can find your client-side code in the `/src/app` folder. This is where you can build your web app using React, Vue, or any other front-end framework.

Things are powered by Vite under the hood, so you get the latest ES modules, hot module reloading, and more! ⚡

Try editing the `main` file to get started! (`Activity.tsx` if you're using React)

**➞** [📚 **Documentation:** App development](https://docs.roboplay.dev/docs/app/overview)

#### Authenticating

The React template makes it easy to authenticate your activity with Discord. The `<DiscordProvider>` components in `App.tsx` accepts `authenticate` and `scope` props.

```tsx
<DiscordContextProvider authenticate scope={['identify', 'guilds']}>
	<Activity />
</DiscordContextProvider>
```

You can then get the SDK and other goodies from the `useDiscordSdk` hook!

## Backend Development 🛠️

Your server-side code is located in the `/src/api` folder. This is where you can build your API, webhooks, and other fancy server-side features.

This backend is powered by the [**Server Plugin**](https://github.com/Wave-Play/robo.js/tree/main/packages/plugin-api) - a powerful Robo plugin that creates an manages a Node `http` server for you. If you install Fastify, the server will automatically switch to it for better performance!

Everything Robo is file-based, so you can create new routes by making new files in the `/src/api` directory. The file's name becomes the route's path. For example, let's try making a new route at `/health` by creating a new file named `health.js`:

```js
export default () => {
	return { status: 'ok' }
}
```

Easy, right? Check out the [**Server Plugin documentation**](https://github.com/Wave-Play/robo.js/tree/main/packages/plugin-api) for more info!

## Folder Structure 📁

While the `api` and `app` folders are reserved for your server and client-side code, you are free to create anything else in the `/src` directory!

Folders only become reserved when you install a plugin that uses them. For example, bot functionality uses the `commands` and `events` folders.

## Plugins 🔌

This Robo boasts an intuitive plugin system that grants new capabilities instantly!

```bash
npx robo add @robojs/ai
```

> Swap out [`@robojs/ai`](https://github.com/Wave-Play/robo.js/tree/main/packages/plugin-ai) with your chosen plugin's package name

With that, your Robo automatically equips itself with all the features the plugin offers. Want to revert? Simply use [`robo remove`](https://docs.roboplay.dev/docs/advanced/command-line#plugins) to uninstall any plugin.

## Deployment 🚀

Run the `deploy` command to automatically deploy to **[RoboPlay](https://roboplay.dev)** once you're ready to keep your robo online 24/7.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

**➞** [🚀 **RoboPlay:** Hosting your Robo](https://docs.roboplay.dev/docs/hosting)

You can also self-host your robo anywhere that supports Node. Just make sure to run `build` followed by `start`:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
